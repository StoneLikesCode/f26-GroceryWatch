## Prerequisites

Install these before starting:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) LTS version (20 or newer)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (recommended; it shows hidden files like `.env`)
- The **Expo Go** app on your phone (update it to the latest version from the app store)

You will also need from the team:

- Access to the GitHub repository
- The Supabase **database password** (shared privately, never in the repo or group chat)
- The Kroger **client ID** and **client secret** (shared privately, never in the repo or group chat). Map, store search, and in-store prices need these. Catalog search through Open Food Facts works without them.



## Getting Started



### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iMakeItFun/f26-GroceryWatch.git
cd f26-GroceryWatch
```



### 2. Set up the API

```bash
cd api
npm install
```

Create your local environment file by copying the example:

```bash
# macOS / Linux / Git Bash
cp .env.example .env

# Windows PowerShell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Open `api/.env` and set `DATABASE_URL` to the Supabase connection string (see [Getting the Database URL](#getting-the-database-url) below). Fill in the Kroger credentials from the team. The file should contain these four lines, with no quotes and no spaces around `=`:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres.<project-ref>:<database-password>@<pooler-host>:5432/postgres
PORT=3000
KROGER_CLIENT_ID=<kroger-client-id>
KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET=<kroger-client-secret>
```

Leave the Kroger values empty only if you are not using Map or in-store search. Those routes then return `Kroger is not configured.`

Start the API:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Confirm it works by opening [http://localhost:3000/health](http://localhost:3000/health) in your browser. You should see:

```json
{"status":"ok","db":"connected"}
```



### 3. Set up the mobile app

Open a **second terminal** and leave the API running in the first one.

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
```

Create `mobile/.env` with the API address:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Start Expo:

```bash
npx expo start
```

The home screen should display **"API: ok, DB: connected."**

## Running the App

**In a web browser** (quickest for checking changes):

```bash
npx expo start --web
```

Use `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000` in `mobile/.env`.

**On your phone with Expo Go:**

1. Connect your phone to the same Wi-Fi network as your computer.
2. Find your computer's local IP address (`ipconfig` on Windows, `ifconfig` on macOS/Linux), for example `192.168.0.156`.
3. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://<your-local-ip>:3000` in `mobile/.env`. Your phone cannot use `localhost`, because that would point to the phone itself.
4. Run `npx expo start -c` and scan the QR code with Expo Go.

Expo only reads `.env` when it starts, so restart it with `-c` (clears the cache) any time you change `mobile/.env`.

## Getting the Database URL

1. Open the GroceryWatch project in the [Supabase dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard).
2. Click **Connect** at the top of the project page.
3. Select the **Session pooler** connection type. Do not use the direct connection.
4. Copy the URI and replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]`, **including the brackets**, with the database password.

A correct Session pooler string has the project ref attached to the username and a host ending in `pooler.supabase.com`:

```
postgresql://postgres.abcdefghijklmnopqrst:yourpassword@aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres
```



## Database Migrations

Schema changes live in `supabase/migrations/` so everyone's database matches. Link the CLI to the project once:

```bash
npx supabase login
npx supabase link --project-ref <project-ref>
```

The project ref is the ID in the dashboard URL after `/project/`. The CLI will ask for the database password.

To create and apply a migration:

```bash
npx supabase migration new <short-description>
# edit the new SQL file in supabase/migrations/
npx supabase db push
```

Coordinate with the team before pushing migrations, since everyone shares the same database.

## Available Scripts

Run these from the `api/` folder:


| Command          | What it does                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`    | Starts the API with auto-restart on code changes        |
| `npm run build`  | Compiles TypeScript into `dist/`                        |
| `npm start`      | Runs the compiled API from `dist/` (used in production) |
| `npm run ingest` | Runs the ingestion job once (run `npm run build` first) |




## Troubleshooting

`/health` **returns** `connect ETIMEDOUT` **with an IPv6 address (like** `2600:...`**)**
You are using the direct connection string. Switch to the **Session pooler** string. The direct connection is IPv6-only on the free plan and most networks, including Railway, can't reach it.

`password authentication failed for user "postgres"`

- Use the **database password** set when the project was created, not your Supabase account login.
- Make sure the `[ ]` brackets around the password placeholder were removed.
- Check that the username includes the project ref (`postgres.abcd...`), not just `postgres`.
- If unsure of the password, ask the team rather than resetting it, since a reset breaks everyone's `.env` and the Railway deployment.

`/health` **returns an error after editing** `.env`
`npm run dev` does not always reload `.env`. Stop it with Ctrl+C and start it again.

`'expo' is not recognized as an internal or external command`
Dependencies aren't installed. Run `npm install` inside the `mobile/` folder.

**App shows "API unreachable"**

- Make sure the API is running in a separate terminal.
- Check `mobile/.env` exists (not `.env.txt`) and has the right `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
- Restart Expo with `npx expo start -c`.
- In the browser, press F12 and check the Network tab. A request to `undefined/health` means the env variable wasn't loaded.

**Phone gets "refused to connect" or times out**

- The URL must include the port, like `http://192.168.0.156:3000`.
- The API must listen on `host: "0.0.0.0"` in `api/src/index.ts`.
- Allow Node.js through Windows Defender Firewall on **private networks**.

`EADDRINUSE` **when starting the API**
An old API process is still using port 3000. Close other terminals running the API, or run `npx kill-port 3000`.

`.env` **file seems missing**
Files starting with a dot are hidden in File Explorer and Finder. Open the folder in VS Code instead. On Windows, avoid creating it in Notepad, which may save it as `.env.txt`.

## Git Workflow

- `main` is always deployable and protected. Do not push to it directly.
- Create a branch for each piece of work: `feature/<short-name>`.
- Open a pull request into `main` and get at least one review before merging.
- **Never commit** `.env` **files.** Run `git status` before committing and confirm no `.env` file appears in the list.



## Deployment

The API and ingestion job are deployed on Railway and redeploy automatically when changes merge into `main`.


| Service | Root directory | Start command    | Schedule   |
| ------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------- |
| API     | `/api`         | `npm start`      | Always on  |
| Ingest  | `/api`         | `npm run ingest` | Cron (UTC) |


Both services need `DATABASE_URL` set to the Session pooler string in their Railway variables. The API service also needs `KROGER_CLIENT_ID` and `KROGER_CLIENT_SECRET` so store search and prices work in the deployed app.

Deployed health check: `https://<railway-domain>/health`

## Data Sources and Attribution

Catalog search uses [Open Food Facts](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/), available under the [Open Database License](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/). Data is crowdsourced and may be incomplete or inaccurate.

Store locations and in-store prices come from the [Kroger API](https://developer.kroger.com/) certification environment (`api-ce.kroger.com`).
